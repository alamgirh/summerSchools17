**Instructor**: Brent Gawryluik (UBC Advanced Research Computing)

**Title**: Introduction to Compute Canada Cloud

**Duration**: 3 hours

**Target audience**: this course is targeted at people who've never orchestrated cloud resources before
and have never deployed web software applications, such as WordPress, in a cloud environment

**Level**: beginner

**Prerequisites**:
- know what a cloud is
- have some concept about what a virtual machine is
- be familiar with using web applications such as WordPress, Drupal, Jupyter Notebook, Omeka, etc
- should be comfortable working with computer files systems, e.g., know how to create and delete
  directories and files on their own PCs
- should have familiarity with a Unix style command line environment (encouraged by not required)
- programming experience is an asset (but not required)
- in addition, if you want to do the hands-on exercises (optional), you will require:
  - a Compute Canada Cloud account with access to either Arbutus (West Cloud) or East Cloud
  - their own notebook computers to work on
  - access to the UBC (or eduroam) wireless network

**Course plan**: The cloud is a powerful tool for conducting and managing academic research. This course
is intended for researchers who want to learn how to use Compute Canada cloud resources to deploy
web-based applications, such as WordPress. By the end of these lessons, researchers will learn how to
accomplish the following cloud administration skills:

- manage SSH key pairs
- manage Security Groups and Security Group rules
- manage and assign Floating IP Addresses
- create and manage Virtual Machines
- create and manage Volumes
- install and administer a Linux, Apache, PHP, and MySQL (LAMP) stack
- deploy and securely configure the WordPress Application (using SSL)

This is a demonstration course. We will try to accomplish as much as possible within the 3h
duration. Individuals wishing to take part in the hands-on demonstration will be encouraged to do
so. However, while the instructor will do his best to ensure that most everybody follows along, he cannot
guarantee that the pace of the course will be able to accommodate all students.
