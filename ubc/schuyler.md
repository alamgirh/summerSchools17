**Instructor**: Schuyler Lindberg (UBC Library)

**Title**: Introduction to Harvesting API Data in Python from UBC Library's Open Collections

**Duration**: 3 hours

**Level**: beginner

**Prerequisites**: While this course is designed to be accessible to novice programmers, a basic
familiarity with Python is recommended. If you are new to Python, please take the time to review
[the free introductory lessons](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python). A basic familiarity with Python
syntax, lists, and loops will allow you to get the most out of the course.

**Course plan**:

This course is intended to cover the fundamentals for programmatically accessing and harvesting data from
open web APIs. It will provide an introduction to the key concepts required to gather data from UBC
Library's Open Collections API using Python. You will learn how to structure and send basic GET and POST
requests, and to receive and parse JSON responses.

- What is an API? A Brief Overview
- Getting Started with the Open Collections API
- Getting item data
  - A single request: Get the full text from an item
    - Make a Basic GET Request
  - Understanding JSON
  - Combining requests: Get the full text from multiple items
  - Parsing the Data
    - Term frequency with NLTK
	- Visualize results
- The Search API
  - Returning search results with a POST request
  - Using aggregates to construct advanced search queries
  - Visualize your results
- Other APIs and ‘Where To Go From Here’

**Setup requirements**: You will need a laptop with up-to-date versions of Python and Jupyter
installed. Instructions for installation can be found [here](https://jupyter.org/install.html). Please
ensure these are installed and working on your laptop in advance of the workshop.
