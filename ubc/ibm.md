**Instructor**: Matt McInnis (Data Scientist and Open Source Evangelist at IBM)

**Title**: Data Science at Scale with Hadoop, Spark and The Data Science Experience

**Target audience**:

**Course description**: There are two technologies that currently dominate the big data landscape: Apache
Hadoop and Apache Spark. These technologies have changed the way large enterprises store and analyze big
data respectively, and IBM is leading way in both the development of these technologies and their
adoption within industry.

In this talk we will:

- Talk about what machine learning is, and experience a live demo of how a simple machine learning
algorithm can be created and deployed on a fully open-source technology stack.
- Learn the basics of Apache Hadoop; what it is, the problems it solves, and why nearly every large
organization in Canada has deployed it.
- See Apache Spark in action, and learn why it is the most exciting and fastest growing project in big
data.

Live code examples will be demonstrated through IBM's Data Science Experience (DSX); our industry leading
tool for data science teams.
