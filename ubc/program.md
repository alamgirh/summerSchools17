**Important**: Before the start of the summer school all eligible attendees must obtain:
1. their Compute Canada acounts. You can find detailed instructions
   [here](https://www.westgrid.ca/support/accounts/registering_ccdb). Please note that you need only a
   CCDB account to log in to the new systems, so Steps 1 and 3 will need to be completed (but not Step
   2).
2. their Eduroam accounts through their home institutions. You will need online access to complete the
   hands-on exercises, log in to remote systems, view documentation, etc., so please make sure you can
   sign in to Eduroam. If not sure how to obtain it, please contact the local IT department at your
   institution.

If you have questions or would like more information on any of the courses listed above, please contact
