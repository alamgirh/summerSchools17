**Instructor**: Patrick Walls (UBC/PIMS)

**Title**: Introduction to Jupyter notebooks and scientific computing in Python

This session is an overview of Jupyter, Python and the SciPy stack:

* Jupyter notebooks: markdown, LaTeX and code
* Python basics: datatypes, logic, loops and functions
* Introduction to the SciPy stack: NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib and pandas

We will learn about these topics while taking a tour of basic scientific computing:

* Computing sequences and series
* Numerical integration and differentiation
* Plotting solutions of systems of differential equations
* Data analysis and visualization

**Duration**: 3 hours

**Target audience**: general

**Level**: beginner

**Prerequisites**:
* no prior knowledge

**Setup**: Participants will use one of the following options to access Jupyter notebooks, so that there
is no software installation required.
