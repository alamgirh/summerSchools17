**Instructor**: Juan Zuniga (WestGrid/USask)

**Title**: Use of GPUs (accelerators)

Session for those interested in the use of GPUs as accelerators of codes written in high-level languages
(Python, Matlab), or using libraries (CULA, CuBLAS, CuFFT, etc.)

**Objectives**:
- Give general introduction to the GP-GPU programming model
- Introduce the GPU accelerated libraries
- Illustrate the use of GPU extensions to Python and Matlab
- Provide a series of examples and practical exercises. Have the attendees run their codes on the cluster.

**Duration**: 3 hours

**Level**: intermediate

**Prerequisites**: *Introduction to HPC* session and some programming experience with C, Matlab or
Python. It would be good to have parallel programming experience from *Parallel programming in Chapel*
session.
